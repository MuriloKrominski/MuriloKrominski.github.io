</ul>

<h2>üåç GLOBAL PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE</h2>

<p>I began my career in Brazil, starting with a role in Telecommunications. I was recommended for this position by my school due to my strong academic performance. Through dedication and hard work, I quickly advanced within the company, gaining experience in both technical electronics as well as areas such as Production Planning and Control (PCP), Quality and Management.</p>

<p>I had the privilege of working in companies of varying sizes and sectors, including multinational organizations such as Valeo Interior Controls and Grupo Amend Cosm√©ticos. I visited numerous companies where I conducted consultancy projects, ISO audits, and solved engineering problems that other companies had been unable to resolve. For example, I developed an innovative, low-cost solution for a persistent packaging problem in a supplier for Grupo Amend Cosm√©ticos, creating an anti-impact system that I designed myself.</p>

<p>At Grupo Amend Cosm√©ticos, I led the Quality, Physical-Chemical, and Shipping departments in a chemical company, participating in activities that included the creation and launch of new products.
Even though it was not my responsibility, I developed a system that solved Logistics and Inventory issues, creating a chain effect of improvements that positively impacted other areas, especially those under my coordination. It was not an isolated event.</p>

<p>I handled high-impact projects, such as coordinating rework teams at MAN in Rio de Janeiro (Renault Logan project) and acting as a warranty representative engineer at Volkswagen. At Valeo Interior Controls, I developed a system called SPPC (Special Product and Process Characteristics), which became the standard in France and was subsequently adopted worldwide.</p>

<p>I gained in-depth knowledge across all departments in small, medium, and large companies, both national and multinational, accumulating experience in logistics, quality, engineering, marketing, and sales.</p>

<p>I also founded several businesses, such as Quero Agregar (a web-based cargo brokerage platform for trucks throughout Brazil) and Grupo Pra Toda Mulher, where I managed the largest women's pages on Facebook in Brazil. In this venture, I worked with affiliate product systems and led a team of editors, applying marketing techniques I developed and refined based on P. Kotler's ideas. I published a case study on this project that was approved by FGV.</p>

<p>In my studies, I developed various systems and engineering projects, including a nitrogen filter for embedded platforms that was almost sold to Petrobras, and a high-efficiency ozone generator, which was laboratory-tested and proven to eliminate 99.9% of pathogens, including superbugs like KPC. I participated in science fairs with smaller projects, such as robots that played soccer and an electro-hydraulic lift.</p>

<p>I collaborated on studies, collective challenges, and solutions for companies like Cocamar, Uninassau, Fiap, Algar Tech, Tecban, Saint Paul and LIT, TNT, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, using technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, machine learning, containers, and IoT.</p>

<p>During my time at major European tech hubs, primarily in Italy and Portugal, I participated in projects and events with companies such as IBM, Google, Relayr, DriverlessAI (H2OAI), Logoplaste, Erising, ManpowerGroup, NOX, and RE/MAX, as well as institutions like the World Economic Forum and C4IR. I was also involved in Metaverse projects (Sansar).</p>

<p>I developed an exclusive technical dossier on Investment Areas in Portugal, which included a comprehensive market study, supported by advanced data science and rigorous validation by the CI. This dossier offered detailed socioeconomic insights and strategic mappings, including 3D video visualizations, providing an in-depth perspective for decision-making.</p>

<p>Upon returning to Brazil during the pandemic, I stepped down from my roles as Commercial Manager (ManpowerGroup Solutions), Client Manager (NOS), Real Estate Consultant (Group RE/MAX), and Investment Consultant (Investidor em Portugal, another former venture).</p>

<p>Currently, I offer high-performance executive consulting, both in-person and virtually, anywhere in the world. My work consists of identifying critical challenges and delivering customized solutions in strategic areas, such as business intelligence, department organization using advanced methodologies, and strategic research utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Additionally, I am involved in personal projects, family businesses, and collaborative initiatives, always focused on bringing innovation and excellence to each one. My mission is to take every business to the next level, maximizing results and transforming potential into concrete, measurable performance.</p>

<p>To achieve this level of excellence, I use the most advanced tools in the market: IBM Cloud, AWS, Google Workspace, Gemini, Microsoft Azure, Copilot, Claude, Perplexity and OpenAI. With these resources, I provide well-founded decisions and transformative strategies.</p>

<p>If you are looking to transform potential into real results and take your business to the next level, let‚Äôs talk!</p>
